# Transferring between Repos
 
Transferring between repos is hard

Naming each repo a different name witin a 
convention can be confusing:
Protip: keep the names of the remotes
the same as the name as the repos

when trying to update a secondary repo with the date in the first:
1) pull data using git pull remote branch
2) add to staging
3) commit staging
4) push to secondary remote
5) Debug
