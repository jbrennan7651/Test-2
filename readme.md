# Transferring between Repos
 
Transferring between repos is hard

Naming each repo a different name witin a 
convention can be confusing:
Protip: keep the names of the remotes
the same as the name as the repos

when trying to update a secondary repo with the date in the first:
1) push data to first repo 
2) change branch to branch on secondary repo
3) pull data from main repo using git pull remote branch
4) add to staging
5) commit staging
6) push to secondary remote
7) Debug
